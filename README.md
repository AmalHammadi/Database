# Database
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)** defines the structure of the database objects, such as creating, altering, or deleting tables and schemas.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is used to manage and modify data within the database, including operations like inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** handles transactions within the database, ensuring data integrity with commands like commit, rollback, and savepoint.
